# Hypothesis
If there n x n 2D array of ints, wherein numbers increase across any row (L->R) and down any column then we believe that our algorithm exhibits a O(n) runtime. 
# Background
Problem: Devise a O(n) search algorithm for a n x n 2D array of ints, wherein numbers increase across any row (L->R) and down any column.

# Experiment Methodology
We are going to test our hypothesis by using System.out.currentTimeMills() when starting the algorithm  and System.out.currentTimeMills() when the algorithm finishes and subtract the two values. This will provide us with the time it took for the algorithm to find the value in the 2-D array.
