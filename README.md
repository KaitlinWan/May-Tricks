Hypothesis: If there n x n 2D array of ints, wherein numbers increase across any row (L->R) and down any column then we believe that our algorithim exhibits a O(n) runtime. 
We are going to test this by using System.out.currentTimeMills() when starting the program and System.out.currentTimeMills() when we end and subtract the two values. There will be multiple test cases the first starting out with a 1000*1000 matrix and ending with a 1,000,000*1,000,000. We are going to run these senarios several of times after multiplying by 10,000 and average the time.
